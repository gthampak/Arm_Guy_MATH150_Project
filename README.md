Connecting with medical care is a choice. Many different factors could be involved when deciding whether or
not to connect with medical care. Perception of your own personal health influences your decision to connect
with medical care for non-major medical emergencies. Although we are able to do some basic self diagnosis
with help of the internet, there is a high chance of a misdiagnosis given the various issues with access to
useful and accurate medical information. Since we do not deem it a necessity if our health is not in a critical
condition, we may decide not to connect with medical care. Apart from the personal health perceptions,
there are also perceptions of health care system, which could include the ability to pay for health treatment.
Lastly, one may not be in the optimal mental space to decide whether or not to connect with medical care,
which could be due to poor mental health or substance abuse.

There have been many studies and surveys which try to gauge the accuracy of an individual personal health
perception and their views towards healthcare. We attempt to widen the scope of personal perception of
general health to investigate factors which could influence an individual’s view and opinions on their own
health as well as primary healthcare. Better understanding the influences on one’s decision to connect with
medical care can help focus efforts in specific sectors to give care to people who require care but don’t know
it themselves.

There are many factors that could lead to differences in health perception. A study shows that people with
higher education better assess their health status (more consistent with medical professionals) (Souto et al.).
Additionally, a study shows that men and women do not perceive their health differently, but have different
views on what constitutes a healthy lifestyle (Mayo Clinic). It has also been shown that there are higher
correlations between overall health and abstract health-related variables such as feelings of general health,
pain, and worry than for concrete and observable variables, such as “bed days” and activity limitations (Leite
et al.). Furthermore, substance users, specifically alcohol, tend to underestimate the negative effect of alcohol
consumption on health and its contribution to injuries ((Sanchez-Ramirez et al.)).
As described, there has been many studies on variables that affect health perception and self-evaluation.
Although many previous literatures explore factors which could impact perception of health, there haven’t
been many who investigate the relationship of these factors with health care perception. A study by Samet
et al. explores alcohol dependency as a factor that affects linkage to primary health care as a secondary
variable, with the primary independent variable being treatment groups to encourage linking with primary
health care. The study concluded that the treatment was similarly effective for subjects with alcohol and
illicit drug problems.

We hypothesize that if factors affect perception of health, they will also have an effect of the individuals
willingness to seek medical treatment. If you perceived yourself as healthy, the time to link with primary
healthcare will be longer than those of perceive their health to be poor.

We investigate significant factors of perception of personal health, to find if they are significant in predicting
the time to link with primary healthcare. We begin by identifying factors which affect personal health
perception, such as age and education. Using a coxph model, we find significant factors in predicting times to
link to primary healthcare.
